- Great benefits
- Generally competent engineers
- Culture of helpfulness and quality in many engineering teams. Most engineers will answer your email and give you advice. 
- Can still find interesting technical work, though there's lots of dull work too, especially if you're more junior.",Cons,"- PR-speak is widespread. Executives use vague CYA communication style. To me it's like hearing politicians talk. Transparency has been steadily going down for years, you hear about projects when they're announced or leaked.
- Several high-level execs seem to have a pretty weak ethical compass. Increasing number of ethical scandals, antitrust fines, etc. Internal explanation often weak and unconvincing around these issues.
- Lots of talk of being data driven but what's common is data being used to justify whatever fits data slinger's narrative, including for myopic goal setting that results in adverse second and third order effects (see Goodhart's law). 
- Increasing attitude of engineers just doing whatever they're told, forget the ""do the right thing"" of old times. 
- Project and product churn. Google products are often unfinished and buggy, UIs changing all the time. Lots of talk of rewarding product excellence but lots of cynicism about it (I don't buy it, I don't see the products getting better). Product managers compete to launch  features; engineers have increasingly less power to make product decisions.
- If you're more senior you might get pushed to do management, the old days of having a technical individual career option seems over in many teams, at least if you want to get promoted.
- Internal frameworks tend to be overengineered and complex because of many disparate use cases and legacy, easy things take a long time as a result. Critical internal tools can be unstaffed while projects that go nowhere (how many chat apps?) can have massive headcount.
- Crowded noisy open floor offices, with little privacy. I heard some folks outside engineering don't even get a fixed desk anymore.
- AI seems much more important than privacy. Products and strategy seem aligned with getting Google more and more data. Privacy unfriendly defaults, UIs, etc. Might make you uncomfortable if you work on a consumer product.",Continue reading,Share on Facebook,https://twitter.com/share?url=undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW22489549.htm&text=Google+review+on+%23Glassdoor%3A+%22Steadily%20going%20downhill%22,Share on Twitter,mailto:?Subject=Google%20review%20on%20Glassdoor&body=Read%20this%20review%20of%20Google%20on%20Glassdoor.%20%22Steadily%20going%20downhill%22%C2%A0undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW22489549.htm,Share via Email,https://www.glassdoor.sg/Reviews/undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW22489549.htm,Copy Link,Flag as Inappropriate

People and culture are still better than most companies but not amazing any longer.
Also company wide issue is detaching from work. Over many years here, I've never seen a college doing well without doing overtime (might be possible in a large operational team though). People may leave the office early but will dial back in to work at night. It was okay when I was single but not when I need family time with 2 small kids.

Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).",Cons,"1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :(",Continue reading,Share on Facebook,"https://twitter.com/share?url=undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW2757802.htm&text=Google+review+on+%23Glassdoor%3A+%22Moving%20at%20the%20speed%20of%20light,%20burn%20out%20is%20inevitable%22",Share on Twitter,"mailto:?Subject=Google%20review%20on%20Glassdoor&body=Read%20this%20review%20of%20Google%20on%20Glassdoor.%20%22Moving%20at%20the%20speed%20of%20light,%20burn%20out%20is%20inevitable%22%C2%A0undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW2757802.htm",Share via Email,https://www.glassdoor.sg/Reviews/undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW2757802.htm,Copy Link,Flag as Inappropriate
Current Employee - Software Engineer III,"May 10, 2014",https://www.glassdoor.sg/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW4204034.htm,"""Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects""",5.0,"in New York, NY","New York, NY",Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,I have been working at Google full-time for more than a year,Pros,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.",Cons,"* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Continue reading,Share on Facebook,"https://twitter.com/share?url=undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW4204034.htm&text=Google+review+on+%23Glassdoor%3A+%22Great%20balance%20between%20big-company%20security%20and%20fun,%20fast-moving%20projects%22",Share on Twitter,"mailto:?Subject=Google%20review%20on%20Glassdoor&body=Read%20this%20review%20of%20Google%20on%20Glassdoor.%20%22Great%20balance%20between%20big-company%20security%20and%20fun,%20fast-moving%20projects%22%C2%A0undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW4204034.htm",Share via Email,https://www.glassdoor.sg/Reviews/undefined/Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW4204034.htm,Copy Link,Flag as Inappropriate
